# Architecture

Badger is a stateless app, all data is carried in memory and cache and it is loaded straight from the blockchain. Each protocol has its own contract architecture and the way the tokens are managed is different in most cases. What the badger does is, for each protocol we have a service that observes the events of the contracts every time that new block is confirmed. 
Based on the type of event, we trigger a new message, for example, the message with type `TICKER` is triggered if there are changes in the `reserves` or `weights` in a pool, since it will necessarly affect the current `Spot Price` of the tokens in that pool. More details about how the spot price can be calculated can be found [here](#ticker-calculation) 


# Websocket

## Ticker

WebSocket endpoint provides real-time market data streaming which works in Subscribe-Publish communication model. After establishing a WebSocket connection with us, you will need to send a message with the channels you want to subscribe.

The fields `reserves` are calculated in real time every time that a new transaction is confirmed in the blockchain. To find a price-independent measure to understand pool size, growth, and transaction volume, we need to look at the trading formula at its heart in each of the protocols. For instance Uniswap V2 uses the "constant product" principle to govern trading â€” that is the product of the two liquidity pools should be the same after a trade as before (excluding fees). The Uniswap V2 price is given by the ratio of the two liquidity pools. The constant product is therefore price-independent.
While in Uniswap V2 the pools have weights equaly balanced, Balancer uses a [`formula`](https://balancer.finance/whitepaper/#spot-price) where the spot price relies on `weights` associated to each token. 

Please go to the section [protocols](#Protocols) for more details and formulas for each of the supported protocols.

## Supported Protocols
- Uniswap V2 (Ethereum)
- Sushiswap (Ethereum)
- Balancer (Ethereum)
- Bancor (Ethereum)

## Channels 

### TICKERS

Return payload expected for the channel `TICKERS`:

```json
{
  type: 'ticker',
  sequence: 19,
  chain: 'ETHEREUM',
  protocol: 'UNISWAPV2',
  swap_fee: '3000',
  pool_id: '0xb4e16d0168e52d35cacd2c6185b44281ec28c9dc',

  transaction_hash: '0xee4370c7529aa605b9cff71c182665ae5c27e4a8b5dddaf1b85cd99d6e429843',
  processed_timestamp: 1616428500,
  name: 'Uniswap V2',
  immutable: true,
  symbol: 'UNI-V2',
  decimals: '18',
  tokens: [
    {
      address: '0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48',
      name: 'USD Coin',
      symbol: 'USDC',
      decimals: '6',
      weight: '500000',
      reserves: '134130853.304658'
    },
    {
      address: '0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2',
      name: 'Wrapped Ether',
      symbol: 'WETH',
      decimals: '18',
      weight: '500000',
      reserves: '75374.524446197184817599'
    }
  ]
}
````


Messages are ordered in the same order as they occurred in the blocks, you can follow the field `sequence` to make sure you are not losing any message. The field `sequence` is incremental and `individial` **per protocol**, meaning, protocol `A` will have a different `sequence` than protocol `B`, the `sequence` also can eventually go back to `0`. You also can follow `blockNumber` that is the block that the transaction was mined.

### ETH_GAS

Return payload expected for the channel `ETH_GAS`:

```json
{
   "health":true,
   "block_number":12154262,
   "slow":10.0,
   "standard":184.8,
   "fast":203.1,
   "instant":226.0,
   "block_time":13.417
}
```

Slow, standard, fast and instant values represent minimal gas price of the latest 200 blocks. by default slow represents 30% probability, standard is 60%, fast is 90% and instant is 100%.

## Usage

- **Connection**

Mainnet: `wss://wss.zinnion.com`

In the example below, we are `subscribing` the `ticker` [`UNISWAPV2`](https://uniswap.exchange) for only the pool [`0x0d4a11d5EEaaC28EC3F61d100daF4d40471f1852`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d4a11d5EEaaC28EC3F61d100daF4d40471f1852) `(ETH/USDT)`  and all the tickers pools of [`SUSHISWAP`](https://sushi.com).

```json
{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "channels": ["TICKERS_UNISWAPV2_0x0d4a11d5EEaaC28EC3F61d100daF4d40471f1852","TICKERS_SUSHISWAP"]
}
```

- **Unsubscribe**

In the example below, we are `unsubscribing` all tickers from [`SUSHISWAP`](https://sushi.com).

```json
{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "channels": ["TICKERS_SUSHISWAP"],
}
```

## Endpoints

### Ethereum Gas Estimation

* Ethereum gas estimation `/v1/eth_gas`. Slow, standard, fast and instant values represent minimal gas price of the latest 200 blocks. by default slow represents 30% probability, standard is 60%, fast is 90% and instant is 100%.

https://api.zinnion.com/v1/eth_gas

Expected return:

```json
{
   "health":true,
   "block_number":12154262,
   "slow":10.0,
   "standard":184.8,
   "fast":203.1,
   "instant":226.0,
   "block_time":13.417
}
```

### Active Pools

* All active pools in the last 24hs. `/v1/active-pools/:protocol/:cursor/:count`. The first request your cursor should be `0` and the subsequent requests your cursor should be the value returned in the field `next_cursor`. If `next_cursor` is equal to `0` there's no more data. Your `count` can change from request to request and the maximum per request is `1000`

You have the option to filter by protocol or simply use `all` to get the active pools in the last 24 hours. We consider an active pool when any type of transaction is carried out. Note that there's no particular order in the responses, you will need to order it using the `block_number` or `processed_timestamp` fields.

Please note that the `count` parameter is the amount of work that should be done at every call in order to retrieve elements from the collection and the result can represent more elements than what is specified in the count.

# Protocols

## Constant Product

Most of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) implement the `Constant Product` formula or some variation of that, it is basically a "pool," containing two (or more) tokens (let's call them A and B), in which the token prices are derived internally, using only the token balances, according to the simple invariant formula: `balance(A)` * `balance(B)` = `(constant) k`, most commonly written as `x * y = k`.

## Pool Lifecycle

Some protocols have dynamic pools where the tokens and weights composition can change over time. Badger uses the field `immutable` as `true` to indicate whether the pool can change tokens and weights and `false` if the fields are immutable. 

## Impermanent Loss

Simply put, impermanent loss is the difference between holding tokens in an automated market maker (AMM) liquidity pool and holding them in your wallet.

It occurs when the price of tokens inside an AMM diverge in any direction. The more divergence, the greater the impermanent loss.
Why `impermanent`? Because as long as the relative prices of tokens in the AMM return to their original state when you entered the AMM, the loss disappears and you earn 100% of the trading fees. However, this is rarely the case. More often than not, impermanent loss becomes permanent, eating into your trade income or leaving you with negative returns.

For those unfamiliar, impermanent loss is when liquidity providers lose returns on their holdings due to volatility on the trading pair. To get a brief idea of how impermanent loss can affect your pool returns, the graph below models potential losses strictly from price volatility. The graph can be read like a 500% price increase against the trading pair can result in a loss in value of 25% of your liquidity reserve.

![](_media/impermanent-loss.png)

When we consider the steps necessary towards motivating users to supply capital, itâ€™s crucial that we explore solutions to mitigate impermanent loss seeing as it currently acts a deterrent in scenarios when LPs *should* be benefitting.

Most recently `Curve` and `Uniswap V3` introduced a new mechanism where the liquidity can be concentrated in certain ranges. This means that liquidity providers can now choose the price ranges in which they commit liquidity instead of covering the entire zero-to-infinity range in the case of `Uniswap v3` and with `Curve` you have a very narrow range where the sleepage is very low when trading stable coins.

## Ticker Calculation

The fields `reserves` is calculated in real time every time that a new transaction is confirmed in the blockchain.

It is important to bear in mind that spot price, which is the theoretical price for infinitesimal trades and no fees, which would incur no slippage. In reality, the effective price for any trade depends on the amount being traded and the fees associated with it.

**Note that `reserves` is normalized to the same decimal unit, so there is no need to convert to their respective decimals.**

### Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap
The prices are calculated using the constant product formula `x * y = k` where pricing function is exactly equal to the ratio of the reserves available to the contract, when no trading fees are taken.

**Spot Price**

Each pair of tokens in a pool has a spot price defined entirely by the balances that each token carries, since we can assume the weights are always balanced in 50% for each token.

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?SP^o_i = \frac{{B_i}}{{B_o} }" 
title="SP^o_i = \frac{{B_i}}{{B_o} }" />

Where:
 - **Bi** is the balance of token i, the token being sold by the trader which is going into the pool.
 - **Bo** is the balance of token o, the token being bought by the trader which is going out of the pool.

Ex: take the following example to calculate the `Spot Price` of `USDC/WETH`

```json
{
    "message": "",
    "data": {
        "pool_id": "0xb4e16d0168e52d35cacd2c6185b44281ec28c9dc",
        "symbol": "UNI-V2",
        "name": "Uniswap V2",
        "swap_fee": "0.30",
        "immutable": true,
        "decimals": "18",
        "tokens": [
            {
                "chain": "ETHEREUM",
                "address": "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",
                "name": "USD Coin",
                "symbol": "USDC",
                "decimals": "6",
                "weight": "50",
                "reserves": "133797118.16274"
            },
            {
                "chain": "ETHEREUM",              
                "address": "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2",
                "name": "Wrapped Ether",
                "symbol": "WETH",
                "decimals": "18",
                "weight": "50",
                "reserves": "75563.903048482010386216"
            }
        ]
    },
    "status": "success"
}
```

As the weights are 50% in each pair, we can ignore this and just divide the reserves to get the price: 

If you want to know how many `USDC` you will need to get `1` `WETH` you have to: `133797118.16274` / `75563.903048482010386216` = `1770.64859 USDC`

### Balancer
Balancer is essentially a generalization of the constant product rule to pools containing two or more tokens. In addition, Balancer Pools assign relative weights to each token, to accommodate pools of tokens with significantly different valuations. The weights represent the proportion of each token in the total pool

Core concepts are:

* Multiple tokens per pool: Rather than just having a USDC/COMP (50/50) pool, you can actually have a USDC/COMP/LEND/SNX pool (yes 5 tokens) that stay based on a certain weight (10/10/50/30)! Why would anyone want to do it? Weâ€™ll find out but for now it can act as an automatic rebalancing ETF where you can get consistent exposure to multiple tokens at onc
* Dynamic fees: that can be set by the liquidity providers or owner of a pool. Sounds simple but if a large majority of LPs think that the liquidity they provide to the ecosystem is valuable, they can come together to increase the fee to increase profits. Such flexibility should be necessary to incentivise capital providers.
* Token: Some skeptics may or may not argue that token incentivised usage is false, however whichever way you look at it the fact that people can earn 20%+ APRs for supplying liquidity and earning native tokens that will accrue value once protocol fees are turned on is a deal.

**Spot Price**

Each pair of tokens in a pool has a spot price defined entirely by the weights and balances of just that pair of tokens. The spot price between any two tokens, or in short is the the ratio of the token balances normalized by their weights:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?SP^o_i = \frac{ \frac{B_i}{W_i} }{ \frac{B_o}{W_o} }" 
title="SP^o_i = \frac{ \frac{B_i}{W_i} }{ \frac{B_o}{W_o} }" />

Where:
 - **Bi** is the balance of token i, the token being sold by the trader which is going into the pool.
 - **Bo** is the balance of token o, the token being bought by the trader which is going out of the pool.
 - **Wi** is the weight of token i
 - **Wo** is the weight of token o

Ex: take the following example to calculate the `Spot Price` of `WBTC/WETH`

 ```json

         "reserves":"16350.856146852319351"
      }
   ]
}
 ```

In this example we have tokens with different weights therefore, we need to use the formula described above.

If you want to know how many `WBTC` you will need to get `1` `WETH` you have to: `(40.38350578/25)` / `(1170.6801725531202697/22.5)` = `0.0310461867 WBTC` 

### Bancor

Bancorâ€™s new AMM design is one that brings the kind of innovation to AMMs that we havenâ€™t seen since they were first announced. The idea is unique in that it uses an oracle to set the weights of a pool rather than relying on a fixed weight. So how does it compare to a regular AMM? Well, suppose in a 50/50 pool of ETH/USDC, if the price of ETH increases to $110 from $100, the pool doesnâ€™t rebalance to force itself back to be 50/50 through arbitrages. Instead, the pool will be 53%, 48% pool (rough numbers).

So what incentive is there to keep the pools at 50/50 (or ample liquidity)? The twist here is relying on fees. Regardless of the current weight of the pools, pools are always split 50% between the two pairings. So if one side gets out of balance, the other side will receive a greater portion of the fees compared to the other side. This incentive allows liquidity to be healthy on both sides.

Bancor V2 relies on every token being paired with BNT, the native asset of the ecosystem. At a first glance this can create friction as people need to route orders through BNT and hope thereâ€™s enough BNT being provided on the other side (Bancor doesnâ€™t require both tokens to be supplied at once). However coupled with a liquidity mining scheme, demand for BNT can be skyrocketed and creating a positive flywheel where an increase in token price causes an imbalance in pool weights (fees out of proportion, not prices) which attracts more liquidity to bridge the gap.

Core concepts of v2 pools are:

* Single-Reserve Pool Tokens: Each v2 pool is anchored to two pool tokens (one per reserve).
* Staked Balance and Current Balance: For each reserve, staked balance indicates the total amount of tokens staked by liquidity providers, and current balance indicates the amount of tokens held in the reserve.
* Dynamic Weights: The pool updates reserve weights to incentivize market participants to equalize the current balance with the staked balance.
* Price Feeds: Price feeds are used for calculating the weights such that after arbitrage closure, the pool price becomes equal to the market price.

**Spot Price**

Each pair of tokens in a pool has a spot price defined entirely by the weights and balances of just that pair of tokens. The spot price between any two tokens, or in short is the the ratio of the token balances normalized by their weights:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?SP^o_i = \frac{ \frac{B_i}{W_i} }{ \frac{B_o}{W_o} }" 
title="SP^o_i = \frac{ \frac{B_i}{W_i} }{ \frac{B_o}{W_o} }" />

Where:
 - **Bi** is the balance of token i, the token being sold by the trader which is going into the pool.
 - **Bo** is the balance of token o, the token being bought by the trader which is going out of the pool.
 - **Wi** is the weight of token i
 - **Wo** is the weight of token o

Ex: take the following example to calculate the `Spot Price` of `WBTC/WETH`

 ```json
{
  "type": "ticker",
  "sequence": 57,
  "protocol": "BANCOR",
  "swap_fee": "0.1",
  "pool_id": "0x6e93665ad9324364e87a61f055969e10c668ac56",
  "block_number": 12116498,
  "transaction_hash": "0xc7952e5a1e00cbd270eb1ebbff3d6b261e4548db7eaca562106f87ea711641b0",
  "processed_timestamp": 1616786160,
  "name": "BNTLPL",
  "immutable": true,
  "symbol": "BNTLPL",
  "decimals": "18",
  "tokens": [
    {
      "chain": "ETHEREUM", 
      "address": "0x1f573d6fb3f13d689ff844b4ce37794d79a7ff1c",
      "name": "Bancor Network Token",
      "symbol": "BNT",
      "decimals": "18",
      "weight": "50",
      "reserves": "146082.49365480128013"
    },
    {
      "chain": "ETHEREUM", 
      "address": "0x99295f1141d58a99e939f7be6bbe734916a875b8",
      "name": "LinkPool",
      "symbol": "LPL",
      "decimals": "18",
      "weight": "50",
      "reserves": "236719.6487200028937"
    }
  ]
}
 ```

In this example we have tokens with different weights therefore, we need to use the formula described above.

If you want to know how many `BNT` you will need to get `1` `LPL` you have to: `(146082.49365480128013/80)` / `(236719.6487200028937/50)` = `0.617111822 BNT` 

### Curve

Before Curve came along, stable coins were a bit of a challenge to swap between since the slippage would be anywhere between 1-3% which is a large chunk if youâ€™re dealing with pure dollars to make an arbitrary transaction. Curve came in and solved this through a novel formula that keeps the price fairly constant in a certain region of the curve while making it more lopsided in other regions. Hereâ€™s a little picture of how the curve looks:

![](_media/curve.png)

As you can see it has a region where itâ€™s fairly flat but then sloped near the edges. This flat region helps Curve optimise the prices so that when you swap USDC for USDT you experience less than 1% slippage. Each pool have a differente `Amplification coefficient.` The amplification co-efficient ("A") determines a poolâ€™s tolerance for imbalance between the assets within it. A higher value means that trades will incur slippage sooner as the assets within the pool become imbalanced. The appropriate value for A is dependent upon the type of coin being used within the pool. It is possible to modify the amplification coefficient for a pool after it has been deployed. However, it requires a vote within the Curve DAO and must reach a 15% quorum.

**Spot Price**

The [Curve Whitepaper](https://curve.fi/files/stableswap-paper.pdf) describes the StableSwap invariant in terms of n coins (with equal weight) in a single liquidity pool.

![](_media/1_curve-formula1.png)

*D* is the variable that remains constant before and after a given trade.

*A* is called an amplification coefficient in the Curve Whitepaper. This subjective parameter is set based on the desired properties of the AMM. For example, a higher value of A would decrease slippage (at least at certain price points).

Diferently from the other protocols where you need to perform calculations, with curve we provide a field called `virtual_price` where you can consider that the spot price for trading any of the possive pairs since theorically we are trading between stable currencies. We also provide the a field called `amplification` that represents the amplification coefficient detailed above.

Ex: take the following example to calculate the `Spot Price` of `DAI/USDC`

 ```json
{
  pool_id: '0xbebc44782c7db0a1a60cb6fe97d0b483032ff1c7',
  symbol: '3Crv',
  name: 'Curve.fi DAI/USDC/USDT',
  swap_fee: '0.04',

  virtual_price: '1.0149324070969434',
  immutable: false,

    {
      chain: 'ETHEREUM',
      address: '0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f',
      name: 'Dai Stablecoin',
      symbol: 'DAI',
      decimals: '18',
      reserves: '299120317.54696152943',
      weight: '0.3333333333333333'
    },
    {
      chain: 'ETHEREUM',
      address: '0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48',
      name: 'USD Coin',
      symbol: 'USDC',
      decimals: '6',
      reserves: '327688735.0082',
      weight: '0.3333333333333333'
    },
    {
      chain: 'ETHEREUM',
      address: '0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7',
      name: 'Tether USD',
      symbol: 'USDT',
      decimals: '6',
      reserves: '334813498.857104',
      weight: '0.3333333333333333'
    }
  ]
}
 ```

If you want to know how many `DAI` you will need to get `1` `USDC` you simply need to check the field `virtual_price`, in this case: `1.0149324070969434`

# Rates Limits

We are imposing a two-stage rate limiting of 5 requests per second (r/s). The configuration allows bursts of up to 12 requests, the first 8 of which are processed without delay. A delay is added after 8 excessive requests to enforce the 5 r/s limit. After 12 excessive requests, any further requests are rejected.
The delay parameter defines the point at which, within the burst size, excessive requests are throttled (delayed) to comply with the defined rate limit. With this configuration in place, a client that makes a continuous stream of requests at 8 r/s experiences the following behavior.
